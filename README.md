**What This Project Is For Me**
1) Java Practice: the first time I used Java was on my first year at university. After, I had exposure to various other programming skills and their applications. Hence, I wanted to brush up my Java skills by bulding this Java based Bank Management System Simulator.
2) MySQL Pratice: I took a Data & Information Management (ISYS2120) course as part of my degree where I learnt concepts such as Conceptual Data Design, Relational Model and SQL, Logical Schema Design, Queries, among other concepts. However, I didn't quite have the opportunity to create a program and apply those concepts as part of the Database Management. This project allows me to not only review SQL theory but combine them with a platform built by myself, storing data from users, and managing those data.

### Day 1: MySQL DataBase setup and conection with NetBeans in Java (testing)
Basic functionalities like filter search bar, displaying users from database and adding new users
