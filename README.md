**What This Project Is For Me**
1) Java Practice: this is my very first React website so there are many aspects which I had to Google up and do research about to understand and overcome any small challenges when building this platform. So I had to self-teach myself a new JavaScript framework in order to prove myself that I could learn and put an initial idea together even without prior experience.
2) MySQL Pratice:

### Day 1: MySQL DataBase setup and conection with NetBeans in Java (testing)
Basic functionalities like filter search bar, displaying users from database and adding new users
